## Design Philosophy

### Why This Flow?

1. **Hearts as master currency**: Creates meaningful decision-making
2. **Dice as consumable**: Encourages session-based play
3. **Lucky Roll as hub**: Single navigation point, no feature bloat
4. **Mini-games as rewards**: Earned through gameplay, not direct access
5. **No parallel menus**: Everything flows through Daily Treats → Lucky Roll

### Constitutional Rules
- Users NEVER access mini-games directly from main menu
- Lucky Roll is the ONLY board (no separate game boards)
- Hearts inventory is visible but dice/tokens are "in-session"
- All games respect the reward hierarchy (meaning > excitement)

## FAQ

### Q: Can users access Task Tower directly?
**A**: No. Users must play Lucky Roll and land on tiles 7 or 22 to access Task Tower.

### Q: What happens if users run out of dice mid-session?
**A**: They can purchase more dice packs with hearts, or exit and return later.

### Q: Do hearts expire?
**A**: No. Hearts persist and can be saved for future sessions.

### Q: Can users play mini-games without Lucky Roll?
**A**: Vision Quest is an exception—it provides passive bonuses and can be accessed for reflection, but the best way to engage with it is still through Lucky Roll tile 15.

### Q: How many times per day can users play?
**A**: Unlimited, as long as they have dice. Typical session: 15-50 rolls depending on pack size.

### Q: Will there be a direct "Games" menu?
**A**: No. The design intentionally keeps games as a reward within the Daily Treats → Lucky Roll flow to maintain engagement and avoid overwhelming users with too many top-level navigation options.
