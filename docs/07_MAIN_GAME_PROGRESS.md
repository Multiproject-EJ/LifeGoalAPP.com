Summary:
- Added opt-in dev instrumentation in `App.tsx` (`?islandRunEntryDebug=1`) to capture first-paint URL flags, bootstrap param consumption, and modal auto-open sequencing.
- Instrumentation emits structured `[IslandRunEntryDebug]` console snapshots aligned to the incident repro protocol (`openIslandRun*` presence, `shouldAutoOpenIslandRun`, and `showLevelWorldsFromEntry` transitions).
- Kept runtime behavior unchanged for non-debug sessions; this slice is diagnostics-only to support evidence-first regression verification.

Date: 2026-02-27
Slice: M7N.4 — Fix lost Level Worlds auto-open intent
Summary:
- Fixed a regression where `openIslandRun` was consumed before `LuckyRollBoard` received the `openLevelWorldsOnMount` intent, which could prevent Level Worlds from opening.
- Added dedicated `openLevelWorldsFromEntry` handoff state in `App.tsx` so entry intent survives URL-flag cleanup.
- Added reactive prop sync in `LuckyRollBoard` so late-arriving `openLevelWorldsOnMount` still opens Level Worlds hub.

Summary:
- Added explicit runtime-state hydration reads from `island_run_runtime_state` so first-run and daily-hearts markers prefer table/API data when available.
- Phased out auth-metadata fallback for runtime marker reads by defaulting to dedicated game-state storage fallback (`localStorage` + safe defaults).
- Kept non-breaking behavior for demo/no-Supabase environments and runtime-table read failures by retaining local fallback state.
