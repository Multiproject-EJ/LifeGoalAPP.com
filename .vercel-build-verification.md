# Vercel Build Verification

This document verifies that all TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.

## Build Date
2026-02-14

## Verified Fixes

### 1. LevelWorldsHub.tsx - State Type Issues
- ✅ Line 33: `completedBoard` state correctly uses `undefined` instead of `null`
- ✅ Line 114: `setCompletedBoard(undefined)` instead of `null`

### 2. LevelWorldsHub.tsx - Mini-game Props
All mini-game components now include both `onClose` and `onComplete` props:
- ✅ TaskTower (lines 121-125)
- ✅ PomodoroSprint (lines 130-135)
- ✅ VisionQuest (lines 140-145)
- ✅ WheelOfWins (lines 150-155)

### 3. index.ts - Duplicate Identifier Resolution
Type exports use aliases to avoid collision with component exports:
- ✅ Lines 51-54: `WorldNode as WorldNodeType` and `WorldBoard as WorldBoardType`
