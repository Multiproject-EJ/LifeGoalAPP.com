# Archetype Card System

## Overview

The 4-Suit Archetype Card System extends the existing personality test to provide a visual, gamified representation of personality as a "Player's Deck". Instead of just seeing trait percentages, users get:

1. **A 5-card hand** (dominant, secondary, 2 supports, 1 shadow)
2. **Visual card metaphor** (each archetype = a card with icon, level, suit color)
3. **Progressive unlocking** (micro-tests level up cards and unlock new insights)
4. **Growth-oriented framing** (shadow card = opportunity, not weakness)

## Architecture

### Core Concepts

**Foundation Test = Opening Hand**
- The existing 29-question personality test generates the initial 5-card hand
- Archetype scores are derived from existing Big Five + custom axes
- No new questions required for the foundation

**Micro-Tests = Deck Evolution**
- Short 4-8 question quizzes that unlock through gameplay
- Confirm cards, level them up (Lv 0 → Lv 5), discover new archetypes
- Measure optional dimensions (e.g., HEXACO) not in foundation test

**Layered Design**
- Archetype system is **additive**, not replacing existing personality scoring
- Existing trait/axis data remains the source of truth
- Archetype data is optional (backwards compatible)

- **Creator** 🎨: Artistic expression and vision-making
- **Rebel** ✊: Status-quo challenging and path-forging
- **Visionary** 🌟: Future-oriented imagination and inspiration

## Scoring Algorithm

Each archetype has **trait weights** that map to Big Five + custom axes:

```typescript
traitWeights: {
  extraversion: 1.0,        // High extraversion increases score
  conscientiousness: 1.0,   // High conscientiousness increases score
  agreeableness: -0.4,      // LOW agreeableness increases score (negative weight)
}
```

The scoring engine:
1. Takes existing personality trait scores (0-100)
2. For each archetype, computes weighted score from its trait weights
3. Ranks all 16 archetypes by score
4. Builds hand: top = dominant, 2nd = secondary, 3rd & 4th = supports, last = shadow

## Card Levels (0-5)

Cards level up through micro-test confirmations and habit alignment:

- **Lv 0 (Unplayed)**: Shadow card — least developed, growth opportunity
- **Lv 1 (Dealt)**: Initial hand from foundation test
- **Lv 2 (Confirmed)**: 1 micro-test confirmation
- **Lv 3 (Strengthened)**: 2+ confirmations or streak alignment
- **Lv 4 (Mastered)**: 3+ confirmations + active growth habit
- **Lv 5 (Legendary)**: Fully evolved — unlocks hybrid potential

## Micro-Test System

### Trigger Types

Micro-tests unlock through:
- **Level milestones** (e.g., Level 5 → HEXACO intro)
- **Streak achievements** (e.g., 14-day streak → confirm dominant)
- **Time-based** (e.g., 90 days → quarterly deck recheck)
- **Card stagnation** (card hasn't leveled in 30 days)
- **Shadow challenges** (player-initiated shadow exploration)

### Blending Algorithm

When micro-test results come in, they're blended with foundation scores:

- **Foundation weight**: 50% minimum (foundation test always anchors)
- **Decay half-life**: 60 days (micro-test influence fades)
- **Min score change**: 2 points (ignore noise)
- **Max score shift**: 15 points per micro-test (prevent wild swings)

Formula: `blendedScore = (foundationScore × 0.5) + (microScore × decayFactor × 0.5)`

## Data Model

### PersonalityTestRecord

```typescript
{
  id: string,
  user_id: string,
  taken_at: string,
  traits: Record<string, number>,          // Big Five scores
  axes: Record<string, number>,            // Custom axes
  answers: Record<string, number>,         // Raw answers
  archetype_hand?: ArchetypeHand,          // Optional archetype hand
  version: string,
  _dirty?: boolean
}
```

### ArchetypeHand

```typescript
{
  dominant: HandCard,
  secondary: HandCard,
  supports: [HandCard, HandCard],
  shadow: HandCard
}
```

### HandCard

```typescript
{
  card: ArchetypeCard,
  score: number,
  role: 'dominant' | 'secondary' | 'support' | 'shadow',
  level: number  // 0-5
}
```

## Integration Points

### Personality Test Results

After completing the foundation test, users see:
1. Existing trait cards (unchanged)
2. **NEW**: "Your Deck" section with DeckSummary component
3. Archetype hand is computed on-the-fly from trait scores
4. Saved alongside trait data for future reference

### ID Tab Badge

(TODO) Wire up `useMicroTestBadge` to show red notification dot when micro-tests are available.

### Supabase Schema

(TODO) Add `archetype_hand` JSONB column to `personality_tests` table.

## Design Philosophy

### Balance Over Maximization

The shadow card is framed positively as a "growth edge" or "hidden potential", not a weakness. This aligns with the app's AI coach philosophy: growth comes from balance, not from maximizing strengths.

### Player's Deck Metaphor

The deck metaphor makes personality feel:
- **Playful** (game-like, less clinical)
- **Dynamic** (evolves with you)
- **Empowering** (you're building your unique playstyle)

### Micro-Tests as Gameplay

Instead of a single long test, personality insights unfold progressively through gameplay:
- Complete habits → unlock micro-tests
- Micro-tests → level up cards
- Leveled cards → unlock deeper insights

This creates engagement loops and long-term retention.

## Future Enhancements

### Full 32-Card Deck

Expand to 8 archetypes per suit (remaining 16 to be added).

### Hybrid Archetypes

When 2+ cards reach Lv 5, unlock hybrid archetypes (e.g., "Commander-Sage" = Strategic Leader).

### AI-Generated Card Insights

Use AI coach to generate personalized interpretations of archetype combinations.

### Deck Sharing

Allow users to share their deck as a shareable image/link.

## Testing

See `/tmp/test-*.js` for validation scripts:
- `test-archetype-scoring.js`: Tests scoring algorithm
- `test-hand-builder.js`: Tests hand construction
- `test-micro-triggers.js`: Tests trigger evaluation

## Backwards Compatibility

All archetype features are **optional**:
- Existing personality tests without archetype data continue to work
- Archetype hand is computed on-demand from trait scores
- No breaking changes to existing data structures
