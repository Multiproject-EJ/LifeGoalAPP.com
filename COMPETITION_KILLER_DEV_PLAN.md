## 0) How to Use This Document (Mandatory)

**Before starting any work**
1. Pick **one step** from the roadmap below.
2. Add a short entry to the **Progress Log** (Section 12) with:
   - Date
   - Step worked on
   - What changed
   - What’s next
3. Confirm the session intent with a **short, generic prompt** like:
   - “Work on the next step in the Competition Killer dev plan.”
   - “Proceed with the next Competition Killer step.”
   - “Continue to the next Competition Killer step.”
   > **Expectation**: I will use a short prompt like this when I want you to move to the next step.

**After finishing a step**
1. Mark that step as ✅ **Done**.
2. Add a summary in the **Progress Log**.
3. Promote any new insights into **Open Questions** or **Decisions**.
4. **Pause for approval** before starting any **larger build** (multi-file changes, new flows, or structural changes). Small fixes and tiny copy edits can proceed without approval.

> **Rule**: One step per session. Keep changes atomic and documented.

## 1) Vision (One-Liner)

**“A personal growth game where rewards are user-defined but system-governed, and your identity evolves through consistent action.”**

---

## 2) App Context (What Already Exists)

This plan must align with the **current product** and **technical reality** of LifeGoalAPP.

### Current Platform & Architecture
- **Mobile-first PWA** built with **React + Vite**, with a desktop expansion view.【F:README.md†L1-L4】【F:README.md†L114-L133】
- **Supabase backend** for Auth, Postgres data, REST APIs, and Storage.【F:README.md†L139-L152】
- **Offline-ready** with service worker caching + Background Sync for writes.【F:README.md†L219-L224】
- **Push notifications** for habit reminders and check-in nudges.【F:README.md†L226-L233】
- **Glassmorphic design system** with light/dark themes and reusable components.【F:README.md†L46-L63】
- **Demo mode fallback** when Supabase keys aren’t configured (local data mirror).【F:README.md†L191-L207】

### Existing Product Surface Area
- **Goals + Habits** workspace
- **Daily habit tracker** with streak insights
- **Dashboard + Calendar** analytics
- **Vision Board**
- **Life Wheel check-ins**
- **Goal reflection journal** with confidence scoring
- **Gamification toggle** (XP, levels, achievements, streaks)【F:README.md†L75-L106】【F:README.md†L159-L217】

> **Implication**: The Competition Killer plan must **extend** these features rather than reset them.  
> Build as layers on the existing PWA, data model, and gamification toggles.

## 3) Mobile-First Product Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Thumb-first UX**: primary actions must be reachable by thumb on a phone.
2. **No dense screens**: prefer progressive disclosure and step-by-step flows.
3. **Fast entry**: Day 0 flow should be doable in <3 minutes on mobile.
4. **Micro-feedback everywhere**: haptics, motion, and micro-rewards reinforce completion.
5. **Offline tolerance**: every core action must be usable offline and sync later.
6. **Single-focus screens**: one primary goal per screen, secondary actions collapsed.
7. **Readable at a glance**: avoid long paragraphs; use 1–2 line summaries.
8. **One-hand safe zones**: keep primary CTAs in bottom 40% of the screen.

## 4) Competitive “Best-of Theft Map”

This is our extraction map: steal proven mechanics, then recombine them.

### 🧙 Habitica — Keep
- **User-defined rewards** as a first-class system.
- **Immediate consequence loop** (miss = loss, do = gain).
- **Social accountability** via shared stakes.

### 🐣 Finch — Keep
- **Emotional attachment** to a companion.
- **Ultra-low friction daily check-ins**.
- **Non-judgmental, self-care framing**.

### 🌲 Forest — Keep
- **Single-session commitment** (start → can’t quit without consequence).
- **Visual growth metaphor** (time = life).
- **Real-world meaning** (e.g., planting trees).

### 💥 SuperBetter — Keep
- **Challenge framing** (quests, not failure).
- **Power-ups for bad days**.
- **Resilience stat** (bounce-back, not just output).

### 💰 Beeminder — Keep
- **Real stakes** (loss aversion).
- **No ambiguity** in success/failure.
- **Commitment contracts**.

### 🧠 Todoist — Keep
- **Rock-solid core UX**.
- **Streak + karma system**.

2. **Immediate feedback** must exist for every action.
3. **Warm, non-judgmental tone** even when enforcing rules.
4. **Identity progression** > productivity stats.
5. **No overwhelm**: gradual expansion + optional depth.

---

## 7) System Specs (Core Artifacts)

### 7.1 Reward Engine Spec (System-Level)

**Core Principle**: Rewards are player-defined, but system-governed.  
Users choose what they want. The system controls when, how often, and at what cost.

#### Reward Object (First-Class Model)
```
Reward {
  id
  title
  description
  category            // Rest, Fun, Growth, Treat, Social, Meta
  cost {
    currency_type     // Gold, Tokens, Keys, Energy, RealMoney(optional)
    amount
  }
  unlock_conditions {
    min_level?
    stats_required?
    streak_required?
    time_locked?
  }
  cooldown {
    type              // none | soft | hard
    duration
  }
  satisfaction_weight // 1–5 (self-reported, later AI-adjusted)
  reward_type         // Instant | Session | Delayed | External
  visibility          // Private | Public | Party
}
```

#### Multi-Currency Economy (Avoid Burnout)
- **XP** → identity growth (levels, stats)
- **Energy** → daily action budget (soft cap)
- **Tokens** → earned only by consistency
- **Keys** → rare rewards / events / unlocks
- **Gold** → flexible, spendable, dopamine

> **Rule**: user-defined rewards **cannot** cost only Gold.  
They must sometimes require Tokens or Keys.

#### Reward Validation Heuristics (Anti–Self-Sabotage)
**Goal**: Allow any reward, but gently guard against rewards that erase progress or become dopamine loopholes.

**Heuristic Signals (risk +0 to +3 each)**
- **Too cheap for impact**: cost < 1% of weekly earnings estimate for “Treat”/“Fun” rewards.  
- **No friction loop**: reward can be redeemed without completing a habit in the last 12h.  
- **High-frequency pattern**: redeemed >3 times in 7 days with no cost increase.  
- **Energy drain mismatch**: reward costs only Gold but user’s Energy is <30% (soft exploit).  
- **Time mismatch**: reward labeled “Growth” or “Meta” but is tagged as “Instant” and <10 minutes.  
- **Negative adjacent**: reward frequently follows missed habits (possible avoidance loop).  
- **Streak risk**: reward is used within 2 hours of breaking a streak (potential coping spiral).  

**Risk Scoring**
- **0–2 (Green)**: Allow silently.  
- **3–5 (Yellow)**: Soft nudge (suggest cooldown or cost tweak).  
- **6+ (Red)**: Require one guardrail (cooldown, token cost, or habit gate).  

**Guardrail Options (never block outright)**
- Add **cooldown** (e.g., 12–48h).  
- Add **Token/Key cost** if Gold-only.  
- Add **habit gate** (“Redeem after 1 completion”).  
- Add **reflection tag** (“What made this feel good?”).  

**Nudge Copy Library (warm tone)**
- “You’ve enjoyed this a lot lately — want to raise the cost or add a cooldown so it stays special?”  
- “This looks like a quick win. Want to pair it with a tiny completion first?”  
- “Let’s keep this reward powerful. Add 1 Token to protect it?”  
- “This reward shows up after misses. Want a gentler alternative for those days?”  

**Developer Notes**
- Heuristics are **suggestive**, not punitive.  
- Store a `reward_risk_score` + `last_nudge_at` to avoid repeated nags.  
- Allow manual override with “Keep as-is.”  

#### Reward Evolution (New, Powerful)
Rewards **level up** with the user.  
Example:
- “Watch YouTube (10 min)”  
→ “Intentional Watch (with reflection)”  
→ “Creative Input Session”

**Evolution States (MVP)**
- **State 0 — Seed (Base Reward)**: The user-defined reward as entered.  
- **State 1 — Intentional**: Adds a micro-reflection or purpose tag (1–2 taps).  
- **State 2 — Elevated**: Adds light structure (timebox, pairing, or mini ritual).  
- **State 3 — Transformative**: Reframes the reward as growth-aligned (creative, social, or restorative).  

**Evolution Triggers**
- **Usage Count**: Redeemed `>= 3` times in 7 days → prompt to evolve.  
- **Streak Alignment**: Redeem after a `Day 3` or `Day 7` streak → upgrade option unlocked.  
- **Satisfaction Weight**: Self-reported `>= 4` twice → offer evolution to preserve impact.  
- **Cooldown Pressure**: Repeated cooldown nudges → suggest evolution instead of tighter limits.  
- **Identity Fit**: If recent vectors trend (e.g., Creativity + Discipline), suggest aligned evolution.  

**Upgrade Rules**
- Never force an upgrade. Offer “Keep as-is.”  
- Evolution cannot reduce accessibility (no extra steps beyond 1 screen).  
- Each evolution state can optionally add **Token** or **Key** cost (max +1).  

**Example Mappings**
- **Seed**: “Watch YouTube (10 min)”  
  → **Intentional**: “Intentional Watch (pick 1 topic)”  
  → **Elevated**: “10-min learning block + 1 note”  
  → **Transformative**: “Creative input → draft 1 idea”  
- **Seed**: “Coffee break”  
  → **Intentional**: “Coffee break + 1 gratitude”  
  → **Elevated**: “Coffee break + 5-min walk”  
  → **Transformative**: “Coffee break + share 1 check-in”  

**First Ship Example (MVP)**
- **Seed**: “Coffee break”  
  → **Intentional**: “Coffee break + 1 gratitude”  
  → **Elevated**: “Coffee break + 5-min walk”  
  → **Transformative**: “Coffee break + share 1 check-in”  
**Why this one first**: universal, low-friction, and emotionally warm; it turns an everyday treat into a gentle social/reflective loop without adding heavy structure.

#### 7.2.c “First Miss” Flow + Power-Down Quest Definition

**Purpose**: Normalize misses, preserve momentum, and teach a **recovery ritual** that feels compassionate and deliberate.

**Trigger conditions (first week)**
- First **missed habit** within Days 1–7 (no completion logged by end of day).
- Or user taps “I can’t today” (manual miss).
- **Do not** trigger if the user already completed any habit that day (avoid mixed signals).

**Primary goals**
- Reduce shame and prevent churn.
- Convert “miss” into a **tiny recovery win**.
- Teach the concept of **Resilience** (identity vector).

**Flow (mobile-first)**
1. **Miss detected (end-of-day or next open)**  
   - Screen title: “Life happens.”  
   - Subtext: “Want a 60‑second rescue win?”  
   - Primary CTA: **“Do a Power-Down Quest”**  
   - Secondary: “Skip for now” (no penalty, no guilt)
2. **Power-Down Quest picker (1 card only)**  
   - Auto-select based on context (time-of-day + last habit area).  
   - Replace with “Pick another” link (opens 2–3 max).
3. **Quest completion**  
   - 1-tap confirm (“Done”)  
   - Micro-reward: Resilience glow + small Gold (+1–3)  
   - Copy: “You recovered. That’s real progress.”
4. **Return to Today**  
   - “Streak protected by recovery” (no numeric streak callout)

**Power-Down Quest definition**
- **Timebox**: 30–90 seconds max.  
- **Effort**: ≤ 2/10.  
- **No setup**: can be done in place, no equipment.  
- **Category match**: aligned with the habit’s life area when possible.

**Quest examples (MVP library)**
- **Health**: “Drink 6 sips of water.”  
- **Mind**: “Take 3 slow breaths.”  
- **Relationships**: “Send a quick ‘thinking of you’ text.”  
- **Work**: “Open the task list and star one item.”  
- **Home**: “Put away one thing.”  

---

#### 7.2.d Weekly Closure Ritual (Copy + UX)

     - Header: “Weekly unlock”  
     - Body: “+1 Key” **or** “Reward upgrade unlocked”  
     - Microcopy: “Use it anytime next week.”  
   - Primary CTA: **“Keep this loop”**  
   - Secondary: “Evolve it” (opens habit/reward adjuster)
3. **Closure confirm**  
   - Title: “Loop locked”  
   - Body: “Next week starts with the same ease.”  
   - CTA: “See tomorrow”

**Evolve it mini-flow (single screen)**

  2. **Change reward** (swap or add +1 Token cost)  
  3. **Change time** (schedule tweak)  
- **CTA**: “Save evolution”

**Copy rules**
- Avoid guilt. Never mention “missed” in this ritual.  
- Keep body copy ≤ 2 lines per card.  
- Always include a warmth line: “Small wins still shape you.”

**Telemetry hooks**
- `weekly_closure_viewed`  
- `weekly_closure_kept_loop`  
- `weekly_closure_evolved` (includes evolution type)  
- `weekly_closure_unlock_redeemed`
- **Growth**: “Read one paragraph.”

**Copy rules**
- Never say “failure.”  
- Use warmth + agency: “You protected momentum.”  
- Avoid streak guilt language.  

**Data + telemetry hooks**
- Log event: `power_down_quest_completed`  
  - `quest_id`, `quest_category`, `trigger_type` (auto/manual), `day_index`  
- Apply identity delta: **Resilience +1**  
- Optional: grant **+1 Gold** if no other completion that day.

**Done when**
- Trigger rules, flow steps, quest library, copy rules, and telemetry hooks are specified.

### 7.3 North Star Mechanic: **The Identity Engine**

**Core idea**: You are not completing habits. You are becoming someone — and the system remembers.

#### Identity Vectors (Behind the Scenes)
- Discipline
- Care
- Courage
- Creativity
- Balance
- Resilience

#### User-Facing Reflections
Instead of raw numbers:
- “You show up even on low-energy days.”
- “You grow when pressure is gentle.”
- “Rewards after effort work best for you.”

#### What This Unlocks Over Time
- New reward archetypes  
- Different UI moods  
- Personalized quest styles  
- Personalized advice tone

> **Why it wins**: Compounds, feels personal, and makes churn emotionally expensive.

## 8) Reward Engine Execution Plan (AI-Ready)

> This section translates the vision into an execution spec that can be implemented **step-by-step**.

### 8.1 Goal
Implement a player-defined reward engine with a multi-currency economy, tied to a 7-day retention loop, powered by a rules-based Identity Engine.

**Non-goals (this phase)**
- No heavy social/party mechanics
- No inventory/gear RPG
- No enterprise/team features
- No full AI personalization (rules-based + hooks only)

### 8.2 Repo Discovery & Integration Points
**Agent tasks**
- Scan README, DEV-PLAN, Supabase schema, and UI routes.
- Identify where habits/tasks/check-ins are stored and rendered.
- Identify current currency/XP systems and how user state is stored.
- Capture UI entry points for mobile-first flows (onboarding, Today, rewards).
- Identify offline sync touchpoints (service worker, background sync, demo mode).

**Deliverable**
- `docs/reward-engine/ARCHITECTURE-NOTES.md` with:
  - Current tables and flows
  - Where to insert reward engine calls
  - UI entry points for onboarding + daily loop
  - Mobile-first constraints (navigation, CTA limits, micro-feedback)
  - Offline/data sync considerations

**Done when**
- Agent can point to exact files/routes/components to modify.

### 8.3 Data Model & Storage (Supabase)
**Minimum viable tables**
- `currencies` (user_id, gold, xp, energy, tokens, keys, timestamps)
- `rewards` (id, user_id, title, description, category, cost, cooldown, satisfaction_weight, visibility, timestamps)
- `reward_redemptions` (id, user_id, reward_id, cost, created_at)
- `habit_events` (id, user_id, event_type, entity_type, entity_id, deltas, created_at)
- `identity_vectors` (user_id, discipline, care, courage, creativity, balance, resilience, updated_at)

**Deliverables**
- `supabase/migrations/*_reward_engine.sql`
- Updated types/interfaces (TypeScript)
- RLS policies: users only read/write their own rows

**Done when**
- Migration applies cleanly
- CRUD works via simple test page or script

### 8.4 Economy Rules (Server-First)
**MVP earning rules**
- Completing a habit: +XP (small), +Gold (small), -Energy (small)
- Completing a focus session: +XP (medium), +Tokens (rare, consistency-based)
- Missing a habit: no punishment in MVP (optional later)
- Power-Down Quest within 24h: +Resilience, +tiny Gold

**Anti-farming**
- Tokens earned once per day (or per streak milestone)
- Keys only at milestones (Day 7 ritual, events)
- Energy resets daily (soft cap)

**P1.2 Currency Earning Rules (Detailed)**
- **XP**: Earned on any completion (habit, focus, reflection). Scales with difficulty: tiny habit = small XP, focus session = medium XP, milestone = large XP.
- **Gold**: Primary spendable currency. Earned with each habit completion and small reflection actions. Bonus Gold on streak milestones and weekly ritual.
- **Energy**: Daily action budget. Spent on completions (habit, focus), auto-resets daily; low-energy completions grant Resilience instead of more Energy.
- **Tokens**: Consistency currency. Earned at most once per day, or on streak milestones (e.g., Day 3/7). Never granted by one-off actions.
- **Keys**: Rare unlock currency. Earned only from weekly ritual, seasonal events, or major milestones (e.g., Day 7, Day 30).

**Deliverable**
- `src/lib/economy.ts` (or equivalent) with:
  - `applyEvent(userState, event) -> newState + ledgerEntries`
  - `canEarnTokensToday(userState)`
  - `grantMilestoneRewards(userState, milestoneType)`

**Done when**
- Unit tests cover: complete habit, miss habit, redeem reward, token cap, energy reset

### 8.4.a AI Scanning Checklist (Before Any Code Change)
**Goal**: ensure the agent integrates cleanly with existing architecture, data flow, and UI patterns.

**Scan in this order**
1. **Data flow**: find Supabase client usage, demo-mode storage, and any existing gamification logic.
2. **UI routes**: locate onboarding, daily tracker, dashboard, and settings screens.
3. **State management**: find where user state is stored/derived (context, hooks, local storage).
4. **Offline handling**: locate service worker caching and Background Sync usage.
5. **Design system**: confirm component patterns for buttons, cards, modals, toasts.

**Deliverable**
- Add a short **Integration Notes** section to `docs/reward-engine/ARCHITECTURE-NOTES.md` describing:
  - Best insertion points (files + functions)
  - Minimal surface changes (avoid refactors)
  - Any conflicts with demo mode or offline sync

### 8.5 Reward Engine (Core Mechanics)
**Create Reward flow (MVP)**
- Title, Category, Cost Currency (Gold/Token/Key), Cost Amount
- Optional cooldown (none/daily/custom hours)
- Satisfaction weight (1–5)

**Constraints**
- Default cost = Gold
- Nudge: “Add at least 1 Token reward for long-term motivation.”

**Redemption**
- Check balance + cooldown
- Write redemption row
- Update balances

**Deliverables**
- Rewards screen/component
- Service functions: `createReward`, `redeemReward`, `listRewards`, `getBalances`

**Done when**
- User can create 3 rewards, redeem safely, cooldowns work, balances never go negative

### 8.5.a Smaller Build Chunks (Recommended Commit Units)
1. **Schemas only**: Supabase migrations + types
2. **Economy core**: `economy.ts` + unit tests
3. **Rewards data access**: CRUD service layer only
4. **Rewards UI (read)**: list + balance display
5. **Rewards UI (write)**: create + redeem flows
6. **Retention helpers**: `7day.ts` utilities
7. **Identity engine**: rules + message generator
8. **Instrumentation**: event logging

> Keep each chunk shippable and documented in the Progress Log.

### 8.5.b Mobile UI Requirements (Rewards)
- **Create Reward**: 4-step wizard (title → category → cost → confirmation).
- **Default view**: balances + 3 suggested rewards max.
- **Redeem flow**: 1-tap redeem + confirmation sheet with cooldown info.
- **Empty states**: “Create your first reward” with a single CTA.
- **Accessibility**: minimum 16px text, 44px tap targets.

### 8.6 7-Day Retention Loop (Implementation)
**Day 1 onboarding flow**
1. Pick one life area  
2. Create one tiny habit  
3. Create one reward  
4. Complete habit → instant reward prompt  

**Day 2–7 daily loop**
- Show 1–3 actions max
- One primary CTA (“Do my tiny habit”)
- After completion: earned currency + “redeem or bank?”

**Day 6 fallback**
- Power-Down Quest if user missed yesterday
- Smallest possible win, grants Resilience + tiny Gold

**Day 7 ritual**
- Weekly closure screen (identity message, highlights, key reward, keep/evolve)

**Deliverable**
- `src/lib/retention/7day.ts`:
  - `getDayIndex(user) -> 1..7`
  - `getTodayPrompts(dayIndex, userState)`
  - `getRitualSummary(userState)`

**Done when**
- Users see correct content by day index and miss behavior triggers Day 6 support

### 8.6.a Mobile UI Requirements (Today + Ritual)
- **Today screen**: 1 primary CTA + up to 2 secondary actions.
- **Progress indicator**: small “Day X of 7” chip.
- **Ritual screen**: three-card layout (growth, highlights, unlock).
- **Animations**: subtle (150–250ms), optional with reduced motion.
- **Haptics**: light haptic on completion + redemption (if supported).

### 8.7 Identity Engine (Rules-Based MVP)
**Event-driven updates**
- Completion on low energy → +Resilience, +Discipline
- Reflection done → +Care, +Balance
- New habit created → +Courage
- Focus session → +Discipline, +Creativity

**User-facing output**
- “You are becoming…” card, no raw stats initially

#### 8.7.a Identity Vector Logic Map (Inputs → Traits → Outputs)
**Purpose**: Turn real behavior into stable identity traits, then into friendly reflections + unlocks.

**Inputs (event signals)**
- **Completion quality**: on-time, late, low-energy, recovery after miss
- **Consistency**: streak length, weekly completion ratio
- **Scope**: new habit created, habit upgraded, habit retired
- **Depth**: reflections logged, journaling length
- **Focus**: timed sessions completed
- **Care actions**: self-care check-ins, rest rewards redeemed

**Trait mapping (vector deltas)**
- **Discipline** → on-time completions, focus sessions, 3+ day streaks
- **Resilience** → low-energy completion, recovery after miss, power-down quest
- **Care** → reflections, self-care check-ins, gentle pacing
- **Courage** → new habit creation, difficulty increases, first-time actions
- **Creativity** → focus sessions + variety of habits, reflections with novelty tags
- **Balance** → mixed habit categories in a week, rest rewards redeemed without guilt

**Outputs (user-facing reflections + unlocks)**
- **Reflection tone** (1–2 sentences):
  - High **Discipline** → “You keep your promises to yourself.”
  - High **Resilience** → “You bounce back with grace.”
  - High **Care** → “You treat yourself with kindness, and it works.”
  - High **Courage** → “You’re willing to begin even when it’s hard.”
  - High **Creativity** → “You thrive when there’s variety and play.”
  - High **Balance** → “You’re building a life that doesn’t tilt too far.”
- **Micro-unlocks** (rules-based):
  - **Discipline** ≥ threshold → unlock “Streak Focus” quest style
  - **Resilience** ≥ threshold → unlock “Soft-Landing” ritual card
  - **Care** ≥ threshold → unlock “Rest First” reward archetype
  - **Courage** ≥ threshold → unlock “Start Something” challenge prompt
  - **Creativity** ≥ threshold → unlock “Mix It Up” quest suggestions
  - **Balance** ≥ threshold → unlock “Rhythm” UI mood

**Vector weights (MVP defaults)**
- Base delta per event: **+1**
- Streak milestones (Day 3/7/14): **+2** to Discipline
- Recovery after miss within 24h: **+2** to Resilience
- Weekly reflection ritual completed: **+2** to Care + Balance

**Stability rules**
- Use a 7-day rolling window for dominant trait detection.
- Cap any single trait gain to +4 per day to avoid spikes.
- Never decrease traits in MVP (positive-only to build attachment).

**Deliverables**
- `src/lib/identity/engine.ts`:
  - `applyIdentityEvent(vectors, event)`
  - `generateIdentityMessage(vectors, recentEvents)`
- `IdentityCard` UI component

**Done when**
- Identity message changes as behavior changes (deterministic, testable)

---

### 7.4 Social & Stakes: **Party System MVP**

**Purpose**: Create a lightweight, opt-in party mechanic where small groups share stakes and unlock a shared reward through synchronized wins.

#### Party Object (MVP)
```
Party {
  id
  name
  owner_id
  members[]          // user ids
  goal_id?           // optional shared habit/goal
  stake_type         // SharedReward | SharedStreak | SupportOnly
  stake_amount?      // tokens/keys if SharedReward
  reward_id?         // shared reward definition
  cadence            // Daily | Weekly
  status             // Active | Paused | Ended
  created_at
  updated_at
}
```

#### Shared Stake Rules (MVP)
- **Opt-in only**: user must accept party invite before any stake applies.
- **Small groups**: 2–5 members max for MVP.
- **Two modes**:
  1. **Shared Reward**: all members complete today → unlock shared reward (token/key payout).
  2. **Shared Streak**: streak grows only when all members complete within the cadence window.
- **Support-Only**: no stakes; just shared check-ins + encouragement.
- **No punishment** in MVP: if not all complete, reward doesn’t unlock (no loss).

#### Daily Loop (Mobile-First)
1. **Party check-in chip** on Today screen (one line): “2/4 ready — join?”
2. **Tap to view party card**:
   - Members + status (Ready / Pending / Completed)
   - Shared goal summary (1 line)
   - Primary CTA: “Mark my completion”
3. **After completion**:
   - If party complete: “Shared reward unlocked 🎉”
   - If not complete: “Thanks — waiting on 2 friends”

#### Fail & Recovery (Warm Tone)
- If cadence window ends with incomplete party:
  - Copy: “Life happens. We’ll try again tomorrow.”
  - Optional CTA: “Send encouragement”
- If user misses repeatedly (3 misses in 7 days):
  - Suggest switching to **Support-Only** mode.

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `party_created`
- `party_invite_sent`
- `party_invite_accepted`
- `party_daily_completed`
- `party_reward_unlocked`
- `party_mode_changed`

**Done when**
- Party object, stake rules, daily flow, fail handling, and telemetry hooks are specified.

### 7.5 Social & Stakes: **Optional Commitment Contracts (Beeminder-Style)**

**Purpose**: Offer an opt-in commitment contract that increases follow-through with clear stakes, while preserving a warm, non-judgmental tone and safety exits.

#### Contract Object (MVP)
```
CommitmentContract {
  id
  user_id
  title
  target_type        // Habit | Goal | FocusSession
  target_id
  cadence            // Daily | Weekly
  target_count       // number of required completions in cadence window
  stake_type         // Gold | Tokens | Keys | RealMoney(optional)
  stake_amount
  grace_days         // 0..2 per cadence window
  cooling_off_hours  // 24 by default
  status             // Draft | Active | Paused | Completed | Cancelled
  start_at
  end_at?
  created_at
  updated_at
}
```

#### Core Rules (MVP)
- **Opt-in only** with explicit confirmation; never default-on.
- **Cooling-off window**: user can cancel within 24 hours without penalty.
- **Grace days**: up to 2 per cadence window (default = 1) to protect from burnout.
- **No shame tone**: missed contract triggers a gentle review + reset option.
- **Caps**: stake amount must be ≤ 20% of current Gold balance (or fixed cap for Tokens/Keys).
- **Real money**: disabled by default; only available with extra confirmation + parental gate (future).

#### Setup Flow (Mobile-First)
1. **Select target** (habit/goal/focus session) + cadence.
2. **Set target count** (default 1 per day).
3. **Choose stake** (Gold/Token/Key) + amount.
4. **Pick grace days** (0–2).
5. **Review + confirm** (clear consequences, cooling-off note).

#### Daily/Weekly Evaluation
- At cadence end:
  - If target met → **reward**: small bonus Gold + “Contract kept” badge.
  - If target missed → **forfeit stake** to a “Commitment Pool” (virtual sink), then offer reset.

#### Miss Flow (Warm Recovery)
- Copy: “You didn’t meet this one. That doesn’t erase your progress.”
- Options:
  - **Reset contract** (same settings)
  - **Reduce stake** (one-time, if 2 misses in 30 days)
  - **Pause for a week** (requires reason selection)

#### Safety & Anti-Overload
- Require **one** active contract max in MVP.
- Block contracts during **Power-Down Quest** (soft-landing week).
- Suggest “Support-Only” party mode instead if user misses 2+ contracts.

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `contract_created`
- `contract_activated`
- `contract_cancelled`
- `contract_completed`
- `contract_missed`
- `contract_stake_forfeited`

**Done when**
- Contract object, setup flow, evaluation rules, miss flow, safety caps, and telemetry hooks are specified.

### 7.6 Social & Stakes: **Seasonal Events / Community Arcs**

**Purpose**: Create lightweight, time-boxed community arcs that boost motivation without overwhelming users. Events should feel optional, warm, and celebratory—never punitive.

#### Event Object (MVP)
```
SeasonalEvent {
  id
  name
  theme
  start_at
  end_at
  cadence            // Daily | Weekly
  status             // Upcoming | Active | Ended
  reward_type        // Gold | Token | Key | Cosmetic | Title
  reward_amount?
  unlock_conditions? // min_level, min_days_active, opt_in_required
  description
}
```

#### Community Arc Rules (MVP)
- **Opt-in by default** for new users; existing users get a soft invite.
- **Low commitment**: 1–2 micro-actions per day (≤ 60s).
- **No penalties** for missing days; progress is additive.
- **One event at a time** max; avoid overlaps.
- **Theme-driven**: 1-line narrative (e.g., “Spring Reset,” “Focus Week”).

#### Daily Loop (Mobile-First)
1. **Event chip** on Today screen: “Spring Reset — Day 2”
2. **Single micro-action card**:
   - Example: “Take a 30-second pause” or “Write 1 word of intention”
3. **Completion**:
   - Tiny celebration + event progress tick
   - Reward drip (small Gold or Token)

#### Weekly Arc Moments
- **Midpoint check-in** (Day 3/4): “Still in?” with 1-tap continue
- **Finale ritual** (last day): 3-card recap
  1. **What you practiced**
  2. **Your highlight**
  3. **Your unlock** (Token/Key/cosmetic)

#### Reward & Unlock Guidelines
- **Daily drip**: small Gold or 1 Energy back
- **Milestone**: 1 Token at midpoint
- **Finale**: 1 Key or cosmetic/title
- **Cosmetics**: badge, theme card, or “Arc” title (no gameplay advantage)

#### Copy Examples (Warm Tone)
- “Want to join this week’s arc? It’s just 60 seconds a day.”
- “Missed a day? You can still finish strong.”
- “Nice — you kept showing up. That’s the real win.”

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `seasonal_event_invite_shown`
- `seasonal_event_opt_in`
- `seasonal_event_daily_completed`
- `seasonal_event_midpoint_seen`
- `seasonal_event_completed`

**Done when**
- Event object, loop, rewards, and telemetry hooks are specified.

### 7.7 AI Layer: **Motivation Style Matching (Inputs → Personas)**

**Purpose**: Detect how a user responds to motivation and adapt copy, pacing, and reward framing to fit their dominant style—without boxing them in or shaming them.

#### Motivation Persona (MVP)
```
MotivationPersona {
  id
  name               // Builder | Challenger | Nurturer | Explorer
  description        // 1-line summary for internal use
  triggers[]         // events that increase affinity
  anti_triggers[]    // events that decrease affinity
  tone_guidelines[]  // copy guidance
  ui_emphasis[]      // what to show more/less
}
```

#### Inputs (Signals)
**Behavioral**
- **Completion rhythm**: consistent daily vs. bursty streaks
- **Streak response**: engages with streak visuals or ignores them
- **Challenge uptake**: accepts “hard mode” or higher difficulty prompts
- **Recovery usage**: uses Power-Down Quests after misses
- **Reward redemption**: prefers frequent small rewards vs. saving for bigger ones
- **Reflection behavior**: taps reflection chips or skips
- **Optional social**: joins parties or stays solo

**Self-reported (lightweight, optional)**
- “Do you prefer gentle encouragement or clear challenges?” (2-option toggle)
- “Do rewards help you most when they’re frequent or meaningful?” (2-option toggle)

#### Personas (MVP Set)
1. **Builder** (Progress-first)
   - **Signals**: consistent daily completions, likes streaks, prefers small frequent rewards.
   - **Tone**: steady, affirming, “you’re building momentum.”
   - **UI emphasis**: streak progress, daily cadence, small reward boosts.
2. **Challenger** (Intensity-first)
   - **Signals**: accepts harder prompts, increases difficulty, prefers bigger rewards later.
   - **Tone**: direct, empowering, “take on the next level.”
   - **UI emphasis**: challenge cards, milestones, upgrade paths.
3. **Nurturer** (Care-first)
   - **Signals**: uses Power-Down Quests, engages with reflections, prefers gentle pacing.
   - **Tone**: warm, compassionate, “it’s okay to go small.”
   - **UI emphasis**: recovery flows, reflection chips, self-care rewards.
4. **Explorer** (Variety-first)
   - **Signals**: rotates habits, tries new rewards, engages with novelty.
   - **Tone**: playful, curious, “try a new path today?”
   - **UI emphasis**: variety suggestions, new reward ideas, light experiments.

#### Scoring Rules (MVP)
- Maintain a **persona affinity score** per user (0–100).
- Each signal event adds **+5 to +15** to one persona, **-5** to an opposing persona.
- Use a **7-day rolling window** to smooth spikes.
- Dominant persona = highest affinity **≥ 60**; if none, use “Balanced” fallback.

#### Adaptation Rules (MVP)
- **Copy tone**: swap 1–2 lines based on persona (Today screen + completion toast).
- **Reward framing**:
  - Builder → “Keep it steady — small wins.”
  - Challenger → “Hold for a bigger unlock.”
  - Nurturer → “Reward yourself for showing up.”
  - Explorer → “Try a new reward today.”
- **Prompt choice**:
  - Builder → streak & consistency prompts
  - Challenger → challenge/upgrade prompts
  - Nurturer → recovery/soft-landing prompts
  - Explorer → novelty prompts

#### Safeguards
- Never show negative or judgmental copy.
- Allow manual “Prefer gentle tone” toggle to override persona.
- Do not change core UX flow; only adjust microcopy and optional cards.

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `persona_signal_logged`
- `persona_assigned`
- `persona_copy_variant_shown`

**Done when**
- Personas, signals, scoring, adaptation rules, and safeguards are specified.

### 7.8 AI Layer: **Reward Pacing Optimizer (Avoid Burnout + Boredom)**

**Purpose**: Keep rewards meaningful by balancing frequency and intensity based on engagement signals. Avoid over-rewarding (burnout) and under-rewarding (boredom) while staying warm and non-judgmental.

#### Inputs (Signals)
**Behavioral**
- **Completion cadence**: completions per week, streak length, time-of-day consistency
- **Redemption rhythm**: redeem frequency, average cost per redemption, hoarding behavior
- **Reward impact**: satisfaction weight trend (1–5) and optional “Did this feel good?” tap
- **Drop-off risk**: missed days count in last 7, time since last completion
- **Effort drift**: habit difficulty increases or decreases over last 14 days

**Self-reported (lightweight, optional)**
- “Do rewards feel too easy, too frequent, or just right?” (3-option pulse)
- “Do you want fewer bigger rewards or more small ones?” (2-option toggle)

#### Pacing States (MVP)
1. **Underfed** (boredom risk)
2. **Balanced**
3. **Overfed** (burnout risk)

#### Detection Rules (MVP, rules-based)
- **Underfed** if 2+ of:
  - No redemption in **7 days** despite 3+ completions
  - Satisfaction weight average ≤ 2.5
  - Declining completions (down ≥ 40% vs. prior week)
- **Overfed** if 2+ of:
  - Redeeming **daily** for 5+ days
  - Reward cost trending downward (avg cost -30% vs. prior week)
  - Energy ≤ 30% on 3+ days in a week
- Else **Balanced**

#### Optimizer Actions (MVP)
**When Underfed**
- Suggest **one** of:
  1. **Upgrade reward** (+1 Token or +1 minute)
  2. **Add a mini-ritual** (1 tap reflection)
  3. **Introduce a new reward** (pre-filled suggestion)
- Optional micro-copy: “Want a slightly bigger win for this?”

**When Overfed**
- Suggest **one** of:
  1. **Soft cooldown** (12–24h) on the most-used reward
  2. **Bank it** default (store reward credit)
  3. **Swap reward** (lower frequency, higher meaning)
- Optional micro-copy: “Let’s make this feel special again.”

**When Balanced**
- Stay silent (no extra prompts)

#### Guardrails
- Never block redemption outright.
- No prompts more than **1x per 3 days**.
- Only suggest changes on **completion** or **weekly ritual** screens.
- Always allow “Not now” with no penalty.

#### UX Touchpoints
- **Post-completion chip**: “Make this reward feel bigger?” (1-tap sheet)
- **Weekly closure**: “Keep it, evolve it, or bank it?” (3 options)
- **Reward detail**: “Pacing tip” hint (single line, dismissible)

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `reward_pacing_state_assigned`
- `reward_pacing_prompt_shown`
- `reward_pacing_action_taken`
- `reward_pacing_prompt_dismissed`

**Done when**
- Inputs, detection rules, pacing states, actions, guardrails, and telemetry are specified.

### 7.9 AI Layer: **“Bad Week” Detection & Soft-Landing Mode**

**Purpose**: Detect short-term life turbulence (stress, illness, overload) and shift the system into a gentler mode that preserves identity progress, reduces pressure, and makes it easy to return without shame.

#### Inputs (Signals)
**Behavioral**
- **Miss cluster**: 3+ misses in 5 days after a prior streak ≥ 5 days
- **Skipped check-ins**: no Today screen open in 3 consecutive days
- **Energy drain**: Energy ≤ 25% on 3+ days in a 7-day window
- **Recovery pattern**: triggers “Power-Down Quest” twice in 7 days
- **Session shortening**: average session time drops ≥ 50% vs. prior week

**Self-reported (lightweight, optional)**
- “Rough week?” prompt (Yes / Not really)
- “Want a lighter mode for a few days?” (Yes / Not now)

#### Detection Rules (MVP, rules-based)
- Enter **Soft-Landing Mode** if **any** of:
  - Miss cluster + skipped check-ins in same 7-day window
  - Energy drain + recovery pattern
  - Self-reported “Rough week” = Yes
- Auto-exit if **2 consecutive completions** or **7 days elapsed**, whichever comes first.

#### Soft-Landing Actions (MVP)
1. **Reduce daily load**
   - Default to **1 micro-action** (“Do the tiniest version”)
   - Hide optional challenge prompts
2. **Streak safety**
   - Convert streak to **“Grace Buffer”** (hold streak visuals for up to 7 days)
   - Prevent “streak loss” copy; use neutral language
3. **Reward cushioning**
   - Offer **Bank it** as default
   - Allow **1 low-cost reward** per week even if completions are minimal
4. **Identity continuity**
   - Show “Still you” reflection chip: “Showing up counts, even small.”

#### UX Touchpoints
- **Soft landing banner** on Today: “Let’s go lighter this week.”
- **Completion toast**: “Tiny win logged — that’s enough today.”
- **Weekly ritual card**: “Want to keep it light for another week?” (Yes / Not now)

#### Guardrails
- Never call it “failure” or “slipping.”
- Never force mode; always allow “Not now.”
- Do not reduce rewards for completions; only soften pressure.
- Limit prompts to **1 per 5 days**.

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `soft_landing_mode_entered`
- `soft_landing_mode_exited`
- `soft_landing_prompt_shown`
- `soft_landing_prompt_accepted`
- `soft_landing_grace_buffer_used`

**Done when**

### 8.10 Feature Slice (P5.1): Single Habit + Reward + Identity Feedback
**Goal**: Ship one tight, end-to-end loop that proves the core system works with minimal surface area.

**Scope (MVP slice)**
- **One habit** per user (no multi-habit UI yet).
- **One reward** required at setup (simple create + redeem).
- **Identity feedback** after completion (single card, no deep stats).
- **Local-first** with sync; offline completions queue.

**Critical path (screen flow)**
1. **Setup**: choose life area → name tiny habit → pick time → create reward.
2. **Today**: 1 primary CTA (“Do my tiny habit”).
3. **Complete**: earn currency + redeem prompt.
4. **Identity**: show 1-sentence reflection + “keep going” CTA.

**Minimal data contracts**
- Habit: `id`, `title`, `schedule`, `created_at`.
- Reward: `id`, `title`, `category`, `cost`, `cooldown`.
- Economy: `balances` (Gold + Tokens).
- Identity: `vectors`, `last_message`, `updated_at`.
- Event log: `habit_completed`, `reward_redeemed`, `identity_message_shown`.

**UX requirements**
- Single-focus screens, 1 CTA per screen.
- Completion feedback within 500ms (optimistic UI).
- Reward redemption sheet includes cooldown + balance preview.

**Success criteria (done when)**
- User can complete the habit and redeem a reward in under 60 seconds.
- Identity message appears after completion (deterministic, rules-based).
- Offline completion queues and syncs without losing reward or identity updates.

**Deliverables**
- Basic habit setup flow (single habit enforced).
- Reward create + redeem flow wired to balances.
- Identity card rendering after completion.
- Telemetry events for completion, redemption, identity message.

---

### 8.11 Visual Growth Loop (P5.2): Zen Garden / Wisdom Tree

**Goal**: Ship a lightweight, visual identity-progress loop that grows with consistent action—without adding complex gameplay or multi-screen overhead.

#### Core Concept
Each completion drops a **“Growth Seed”** into a **Zen Garden** (short-term) that slowly cultivates a **Wisdom Tree** (long-term identity arc).  
This provides a **visual reward** that is calming, readable at a glance, and emotionally resonant.

#### Visual Layers (MVP)
1. **Zen Garden (Daily/Weekly)**
   - A small tile/scene that grows **1–3 micro-elements** per week.
   - Represents **recent consistency**.
2. **Wisdom Tree (Monthly/Seasonal)**
   - A single tree that grows **one stage** per 2–4 weeks of consistent action.
   - Represents **long-term identity evolution**.

#### Growth States (MVP)
**Zen Garden (weekly loop)**
- **State 0**: Empty sand + soft glow  
- **State 1**: 1 seed sprout  
- **State 2**: 2–3 sprouts + small stone  
- **State 3**: 1 small plant + subtle light rays  
- **State 4**: Garden in bloom (reset after weekly ritual)

**Wisdom Tree (monthly loop)**
- **Stage 1**: Sapling  
- **Stage 2**: Young tree  
- **Stage 3**: Strong tree  
- **Stage 4**: Flourishing tree + small fruit  
- **Stage 5**: Ancient tree (badge/title unlocked)

#### Growth Rules (MVP)
**Zen Garden**
- **+1 growth** on each habit completion (max 4 per week).
- **Day 7 ritual** finalizes the garden and **resets** to State 0 next week.
- If a week has **0 completions**, garden shows **soft wind** animation (no penalty).

**Wisdom Tree**
- **+1 stage** after **3+ weeks with ≥4 completions**.
- **Grace buffer**: a “bad week” doesn’t reduce stage, only pauses growth.
- **Power-Down Quests** count as **0.5** completions toward weekly totals.

#### UX Touchpoints
- **Today screen**: mini garden thumbnail (top-right) with 1-line copy:
  - “Your garden is growing.” / “A small seed today?”
- **Completion toast**: micro-sparkle + “Seed planted.”
- **Weekly ritual**: shows full Zen Garden state + “Carry a seed into your tree.”
- **Monthly check-in**: “Your Wisdom Tree grew to ___.”

#### Rewards & Identity Tie-In
- Zen Garden growth boosts **identity reflection** copy:
  - “You’re someone who shows up even in small ways.”
- Wisdom Tree stage unlocks:
  - **Stage 3**: 1 Key
  - **Stage 5**: Cosmetic badge/title (e.g., “Rooted”)

#### Data Model (Minimal)
```
GardenState {
  user_id
  week_start
  garden_state      // 0-4
  weekly_completions
  last_growth_at
}

WisdomTreeState {
  user_id
  stage            // 1-5
  streak_weeks     // count of qualifying weeks
  last_growth_at
}
```

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `garden_growth_incremented`
- `garden_week_finalized`
- `tree_stage_upgraded`
- `tree_stage_rewards_unlocked`

**Done when**
- Growth states and rules are defined.
- UX touchpoints specified for Today, completion, weekly ritual, and monthly check-in.
- Minimal data model + telemetry hooks documented.

### 8.12 Phase 6 Decision: MVP Currency Set (P6.1)

**Decision**: Ship **XP + Gold** as the MVP currency set.  
**Not shipping yet**: Energy, Tokens, Keys.

#### Rationale
- **Aligns with current product**: XP/levels already exist in the gamification system, so XP is a natural carry-forward.
- **Keeps the reward loop simple**: Gold is the single spendable currency for user-defined rewards.
- **Reduces cognitive load**: two currencies are easy to explain on Day 0–1.
- **Leaves room to expand**: Energy, Tokens, and Keys remain reserved for later progression layers.

#### MVP Behavior (Rules Snapshot)
- **XP**: Earned on habit completion and streak milestones; used for levels/identity feedback only.
- **Gold**: Earned on habit completion; spent on rewards.
- **No Energy/Token/Key balances** in the UI or data model during MVP.

#### UI/UX Implications
- Show **XP gain + Gold gain** together on completion.
- Reward creation shows **Gold cost** only.
- Identity feedback references XP/level progress (no multi-currency jargon).

#### Telemetry (Additions)
- `currency_xp_earned`
- `currency_gold_earned`
- `currency_gold_spent`

**Done when**
- MVP currency set is explicitly chosen, with rationale and UX implications.

---

### 8.13 Phase 6 Decision: Map XP/Level to Multi-Currency (P6.2)

**Goal**: Preserve the existing XP/level system as the **identity progression layer**, while converting the current **Points** currency into **Gold** for the MVP economy.

#### Current System Snapshot (What Exists Today)
- **XP + Levels**: `total_xp` and `current_level` drive identity progress and level-up notifications.
- **Points**: Earned at **1 point per 10 XP**, displayed as a spendable currency in the gamification header.
- **XP Transactions**: `xp_transactions` table logs XP earns for audit and UI history.

#### Mapping Rules (MVP)
1. **XP stays XP**  
   - Keep all existing XP earning rules, sources, and level thresholds intact.  
   - XP remains **non-spendable** and purely tied to identity/level progression.
2. **Points become Gold**  
   - Rename “Points” → **Gold** in UI copy and data semantics.  
   - **Gold = Points balance** (1:1 on migration).
3. **Gold earning mirrors existing Points logic**  
   - Continue awarding **1 Gold per 10 XP** across all XP sources.  
   - Result: no behavioral change for current users; just a naming and framing shift.
4. **Gold is spendable; XP is not**  
   - Rewards cost Gold; XP only affects levels and identity feedback.

#### Data Model Migration (Conceptual)
- `gamification_profiles.total_points` → **`gold_balance`** (new field)  
- Keep `total_points` as **legacy** for migration safety, then deprecate.
- No changes to XP tables needed for MVP.

#### UI/UX Adjustments
- Gamification header replaces **Points (💎)** with **Gold (🪙)**.
- Reward creation and redemption use **Gold** only.
- Level-up and XP progress visuals remain unchanged.

#### Telemetry Additions
- `currency_gold_earned` (mapped from XP → Gold conversion)
- `currency_gold_spent`
- `currency_xp_earned` (already used; confirm naming consistency)

**Done when**
- A clear mapping is defined between XP, levels, and Gold (formerly Points).
- Migration path for `total_points` → `gold_balance` is documented.
- UI language swap from Points → Gold is specified.

### 8.14 Phase 6 Decision: Identity Vector Visibility + Naming (P6.3)

**Decision**: Keep raw identity vectors **hidden by default**, and surface them as **friendly, user-facing “Identity Signals”** in lightweight places (identity card + optional detail sheet).

#### Rationale
- **Avoids cognitive load** early in onboarding; keeps Day 0–7 flow simple.
- **Preserves magic**: users feel “seen” without being asked to interpret stats.
- **Keeps room for evolution**: vectors can later become visible if/when users opt in.

#### Visibility Rules (MVP)
- **Default**: show only a 1–2 sentence **identity reflection** after completion or weekly ritual.
- **Optional detail**: a small “Why this?” link on the Identity card opens a sheet with up to **3 identity signals**.
- **No raw scores** in MVP; show **signal names + short descriptions** only.
- **Unlock timing**: identity signals detail sheet appears **after Day 3** or after the first weekly ritual, whichever comes first.

#### Naming Rules (User-Facing)
- Use **Identity Signals** as the umbrella term (avoid “stats” or “vectors”).
- Signal labels are friendly nouns:
  - **Discipline** → “Follow-Through”
  - **Resilience** → “Bounce-Back”
  - **Care** → “Kindness”
  - **Courage** → “Bravery”
  - **Creativity** → “Curiosity”
  - **Balance** → “Harmony”
- Each signal has a **1-line explanation** (e.g., “You keep promises to yourself.”).

#### UX Touchpoints
- **Completion**: “You’re becoming someone who keeps promises to yourself.”
- **Weekly ritual**: show the top 1 signal and a “Why this?” link.
- **Settings (optional)**: “Identity Signals” explanation card with opt-in to show signals earlier.

**Done when**
- Default visibility and unlock timing are defined.
- User-facing naming for all signals is finalized.
- UX touchpoints for reflection + optional details are specified.

### 8.15 Phase 6 Decision: Tree of Life Growth Loop (P6.4)

**Decision**: Anchor real-world meaning inside the **Zen Garden** as a **Tree of Life & Wisdom** that grows with weekly closure rituals, level-ups, and long-term consistency.

#### Rationale
- **Unified growth loop**: the Tree of Life becomes the long-term anchor, while the Zen Garden remains the short-term playground.
- **Clear identity arc**: one master tree ties progression to wisdom rather than external impact tally.
- **Scalable**: can still connect to real-world impact later without changing the core growth loop.

#### MVP Rules (Tree of Life & Wisdom)
- **Unit**: 1 watering = 1 growth credit (system-managed, not user-spendable).
- **Earn triggers** (MVP):
  - **Weekly closure** completed → +1 watering.
  - **30-day streak milestone** → +3 waterings.
  - **Seasonal event completion** → +5 waterings (if seasonal events are active).
  - **Level-up** → +1 watering (reinforces long-term progression).
- **Visibility**:
  - Show a **Tree of Life growth counter** in the dashboard footer and Zen Garden.
  - Show a **celebration modal** when the tree grows (1–2 lines of warm copy).
  - Offer a “See growth” detail sheet (ledger + dates).
- **Copy tone**: quiet pride, non-judgmental (“Your Tree of Life grew stronger.”).

#### Data Notes (MVP)
- **Tree ledger** table or JSON log: `date`, `source`, `amount`, `notes`.
- **Growth stages**: store `stage` or `level` when ready (optional in MVP).

#### Telemetry Hooks
- `tree_of_life_awarded` (source, amount, streak_length, season_id?, level?)
- `tree_of_life_viewed` (surface: modal | detail_sheet)

**Done when**
- Feature selected and named.
- MVP rules and triggers defined.
- Visibility and telemetry defined.

  - **Step**: P8.2 Add reward category tagging (Rest, Fun, Growth, Treat, Social, Meta) to creation + display  
  - **What changed**: Added RewardCategory type ('Rest', 'Fun', 'Growth', 'Treat', 'Social', 'Meta') to types, category field to RewardItem interface with default 'Treat', category picker UI in ScoreTab with 6 pill buttons showing emoji+label, category badge display on reward cards, and CSS styling for category UI components.  
  - **What's next**: P8.3 Add reward evolution seed state (tracks reward maturity/unlock time).

- **2026-02-11**  
  - **Step**: P8.4 Extend streak milestones config (add Day 7 + Day 14 Tree of Life awards alongside Day 30)  
  - **What changed**: Added Day 7 (+1 watering) and Day 14 (+2 waterings) Tree of Life awards alongside existing Day 30 (+3 waterings, updated from +1) and Day 100 (+5 waterings) milestones. Created centralized STREAK_TREE_MILESTONES config. Added STREAK_14_DAYS: 250 XP reward constant. Updated ImpactTreeSource type from 'streak_30' to 'streak_milestone' for generalized streak handling. Updated telemetry event from 'tree_streak_award' to 'tree_of_life_awarded' with streak_milestone source and amount metadata.  
  - **What's next**: P8.5 Add reward pacing state detection (Underfed / Balanced / Overfed rules-based engine).

- **2026-02-11**  
  - **Step**: P8.5 Add reward pacing state detection (Underfed / Balanced / Overfed rules-based engine)  
  - **What changed**: Added rules-based reward pacing engine with Underfed/Balanced/Overfed detection, suggestion generation (upgrade/ritual/new for Underfed; cooldown/bank/swap for Overfed), guardrails (1x per 3 days prompt limit), localStorage persistence (lifegoal_reward_pacing_{userId}), and telemetry hooks (reward_pacing_state_assigned, reward_pacing_prompt_shown, reward_pacing_action_taken, reward_pacing_prompt_dismissed). Created src/lib/rewardPacing.ts with analyzeRewardPacing(), canShowPrompt(), and markPromptShown() functions. Added PacingState, PacingAnalysis, PacingSuggestion types to src/types/gamification.ts. Integrated pacing chip into ScoreTab with visual prompt banner (purple gradient) showing suggestion icon, title, description, and "Not now"/"Got it" action buttons. Detection rules: Underfed if 2+ signals (no redemption 7d + 3+ completions, declining completions ≥40%), Overfed if 2+ signals (daily redemptions 5+ days, cost trending down ≥30%, low variety >80%).  
  - **What's next**: P8.6 Centralize Identity Signal copy config (friendly labels + 1-line explanations in a shared config).

- **2026-02-11**  
  - **Step**: P8.6 Centralize Identity Signal copy config (friendly labels + 1-line explanations in a shared config)  
  - **What changed**: Created centralized identity signal config (src/lib/identitySignalConfig.ts) with IdentitySignalConfig interface and IDENTITY_SIGNALS array containing all 6 identity vectors with friendly user-facing labels (Discipline→Follow-Through, Resilience→Bounce-Back, Care→Kindness, Courage→Bravery, Creativity→Curiosity, Balance→Harmony), 1-line descriptions, reflection messages (high/growing), icons (🎯🛡️💛🦁🎨⚖️), and accent colors. Added helper functions: getSignalConfig(key), getSignalLabel(key), getSignalReflection(key, strength), getTopSignals(vectors, count). Added IdentityVectorKey type to src/types/gamification.ts. No existing hardcoded identity vector copy found in components (current Identity Signals card uses personality test data, not vector-specific labels). Build passes successfully.  
  - **What's next**: Phase 8 complete! Review Phase 9 options or address open polish items.

- **2026-02-11**  
  - **Step**: Reward evolution State 2→3 (Transformative) polish  
  - **What changed**: Replaced State 2→3 placeholder with full category-specific Transformative templates (Rest→connection, Fun→creative, Social→shared goals, Growth→teaching, Treat→mindfulness, Meta→identity reflection). Updated shouldPromptEvolution to allow State 2→3 transitions (changed evolutionState >= 2 to >= 3). Added State 2 modal copy ("🌳 Transform..." with growth story prompt). Added "🌳 Evolved" badge on fully evolved State 3 rewards with green styling. All changes in src/lib/rewardEvolution.ts, src/services/rewards.ts, src/features/gamification/RewardEvolutionModal.tsx, src/features/gamification/ScoreTab.tsx, and src/styles/gamification.css. Build passes successfully. Telemetry events already support State 2→3 transitions via fromState/toState metadata.  
  - **What's next**: Evaluate Phase 9 roadmap or additional polish items.
